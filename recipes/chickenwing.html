            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat 6 cups canola oil in a large pot or Dutch oven to 350Â°F. Fit a wire rack over a rimmed baking sheet, or line the baking sheet with paper towels. Season 2 pounds chicken wings with 1/2 teaspoon of the kosher salt and a few grinds of black pepper.
                </li>
                <li>Place 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon sweet paprika, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon onion powder, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Add the wings and toss until each wing is well-coated.
                </li>
                <li>When the oil is ready, fry the wings in 2 to 3 batches: Add to the oil and fry until cooked through, golden-brown, and crisp, 5 to 8 minutes. Use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer wings to the baking sheet. Let cool 5 minutes before serving.
